# Antenna-Design
Used an Ansys Software (an Electronic Simulation device) to create a Microstrip Patch Antenna. With the Antenna we obtained the Electric field Pattern, Magnetic field Pattern and Radiation Pattern of the Antenna. We performed the simulation and understood the simulation of Antenna in various conditions.
